## 💡 Business Impact

### ROI Analysis

**Scenario**: 100,000 customers, 26.5% churn rate

**Without Churn Prediction:**
- Annual churn: 26,500 customers
- Lost revenue: $53,000,000 (@ $2,000 avg LTV)

**With Churn Prediction:**
- Detection rate: 80% (21,200 identified)
- Retention success: 30% (6,360 saved)
- **Revenue retained: $12,720,000**
- Implementation cost: $500,000
- **First-year ROI: 2,020%**

1. **Contract Upgrade Incentive**
   - Offer 15-25% discount for 1-2 year commitment
   - Expected impact: 18-22% churn reduction

2. **Early Engagement Program**
   - Onboarding support for customers <6 months
   - Expected impact: 35% reduction in early churn

3. **Payment Method Migration**
   - $5/month discount for automatic payments
   - Expected impact: 12-15% churn reduction

4. **Service Bundle Promotion**
   - 3-month free trial of Tech Support & Security
   - Expected impact: 8-10% churn reduction

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Problem**: Sidebar not visible  
**Solution**: Click the blue "☰ Menu" button in top-left, or press `[` key

**Problem**: Model file not found  
**Solution**: Ensure `churn_pipeline.pkl` is in the same directory as the app

**Problem**: Prediction error for single customer  
**Solution**: Check that all fields are filled correctly, especially tenure and charges

**Problem**: Batch CSV processing fails  
**Solution**: Verify CSV has all required columns with exact names (case-sensitive)

**Problem**: Page loading is slow  
**Solution**: Model caching is enabled; first load takes longer

**Problem**: Charts not displaying  
**Solution**: Use a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge). Disable ad-blockers.
